# Japanese Sushi Restaurant Website - Sushi Doshira

## Summary

This is the website for a Japanese sushi restaurant called Sushi Doshira (鮨どしら) that showcases my ability to design responsive layouts and implement them using component-based frameworks (React.js/Next.js) with internationalization (i18n), SEO optimization, animations, and accessibility features.

## Responsive Design

I designed a responsive layout for mobile and desktop using Figma (and Photoshop for the logo) and implemented the design using TypeScript, React.js/Next.js, and Tailwind CSS making sure it works properly on different screen sizes in both English and Japanese versions.

## Customizability

I have divided every section into smaller components that can be easily modified and re-used in the future. I have kept all the data like menu items and prices in `.json` files and loaded them dynamically so they can be modified with ease.

## Internationalization (i18n)

I have implemented Internationalization with an English and a Japanese version. The translations are kept in separate `.json` files and can be modified easily. I have used a different font for each version and adjusted the layout to work for both versions.

## Animations

I have added custom-made reveal animations using a custom component I made using Framer Motion.

## Slider

I heavily customized the slider with color, size, and animations to match the design and the feel of the website.

## Accessibility

I improved the website's accessibility by adding ARIA properties and testing how the website behaves for people with disabilities. I adjusted the heading/section structure of the website and added screen-reader-only titles to the sections that needed it.

## SEO Optimization

This website is optimized for search engines using metadata like description, keywords, OpenGraph, Twitter card, and more. 

## Asset Optimization

All of the images used in this application have responsive sizes according to the device size to limit bandwidth usage and deliver a great end-user experience. All of the fonts are cached and served from the same server for faster load times.

## Lighthouse Benchmark

![100 Lighthouse score](/screenshots/lighthouse.png)
> 91 SEO score is because of a bug with Next.js/Lighthouse (robots.txt) and will be fixed in the future.

## Small Touches

I have made my own custom elements like a scroll-to-top component and a scroll-down element with animation instead of relying on external packages/assets.
